### backupninja PostgreSQL config file ###

<% if @when != '' %>when = <%= @when %><% end -%>

# backupdir = <dir> (default: /var/backups/postgres)
# where to dump the backups

backupdir = <%= @backupdir %>
# databases = < all | db1 db2 db3 > (default = all)
# which databases to backup. should either be the word 'all' or a 
# space separated list of database names.
# Note: when using 'all', pg_dumpall is used instead of pg_dump, which means
# that cluster-wide data (such as users and groups) are saved.
databases = <% if @databases %><%= @databases %><% else %>all<% end %>

# compress = < yes | no > (default = yes)
# if yes, compress the pg_dump/pg_dumpall output. 
compress = <% if @compress %><%= @compress %><% else %>yes<% end %>

# format = < plain | tar | custom > (default = plain)
# plain -  Output a plain-text SQL script file with the extension .sql.
#          When dumping all databases, a single file is created via pg_dumpall.
# tar -    Output a tar archive suitable for input into pg_restore. More
#          flexible than plain and can be manipulated by standard Unix tools
#          such as tar. Creates a globals.sql file and an archive per database.
# custom - Output a custom PostgreSQL pg_restore archive. This is the most
#          flexible format allowing selective import and reordering of database
#          objects at the time the database is restored via pg_restore. This
#          option creates a globals.sql file containing the cluster role and
#          other information dumped by pg_dumpall -g and a pg_restore file
#          per selected database. See the pg_dump and pg_restore man pages.
format = <% if @format %><%= @format %><% else %>plain<% end %>

### You can also set the following variables in backupninja.conf:
# PSQL: psql path (default: /usr/bin/psql)
# PGSQLDUMP: pg_dump path (default: /usr/bin/pg_dump)
# PGSQLDUMPALL: pg_dumpall path (default: /usr/bin/pg_dumpall)
# PGSQLUSER: user running PostgreSQL (default: postgres)
